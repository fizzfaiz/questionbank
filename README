NAME

Question Bank

SUMMARY

A system to collect and deliver QTI items, easily allowing derivative items to 
be authored and deposited.

REQUIREMENTS

-	Web server such as Apache or Lighttpd
-	PHP 5 (tested on PHP 5.2.4)
-	The Sqlite3 module for PHP
-	An instance of QTIEngine to call (the demonstration version at 
	qtiengine.qtitools.org is used by default)
-	Eqiat (imported as a subdirectory) and all of its dependencies (see its 
	README)

SOURCE

The source is available at <http://github.com/tremby/questionbank>.

COMPILATION

Eqiat's dependency, validate, must be compiled -- see its own README file.

INSTALLATION

Extract the full tree to a directory visible to the web server.

The user running PHP must have read and write permissions to db, the database 
subdirectory. If necessary you can do this manually by running commands similar 
to the following:
	chmod 770 db
	chown :www-data db
where www-data is the user running PHP. You may also want to configure your web 
server not to serve anything within the db subdirectory.

CONFIGURATION

The options are constants found at the bottom of include/constants.php:
	QTIENGINE_HOST
		edit this to use a custom instance of QTIEngine
	SITE_TITLE
		edit this to use a custom site title (it defaults to Eqiat)

USAGE

todo: write this
